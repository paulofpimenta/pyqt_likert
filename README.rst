==========================
Combining Pyqt and Plotly
==========================

This script gets an input data (excel file) and generates an
interactive Likert scale plot using the Plotly library

An example using the likert scale
----------------------------------

The GUI is based on a small sample of Villanueva's dissertation data.
The excel file (sample.xlsx) is a subset of qualitative data survey that aimed to understand people's perception on
how much they value ecosystem services towards landscapes.

The ecosystem services were the following :

- Food
- Wood
- Water supply
- Regulation
- Air quality
- Scenic beauty

With four possible landscapes :

- Agriculture
- Forest
- Settlement
- Grassland

Through the GUI, the user can select the data (excel file), the ecosystem service and the landscape. Additionally,
people can be grouped by gender, age, age class, education or activity.
